            <p>My career in technology started when I was 6 and my parents brought home a computer they where given at work.  Manufactured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation">Sperry Corperation</a>, this was an 8086 that did not even come with an operating system, only a basic compiler on a 5.25 floppy disk.  Over the next 10 years I found a passion for online connectivity through BBS's.  Making lifelong friendships, and solidifying a foundation of learning that has carried me through my 24+ year career in technology.</p>
            <p>Given that my livelyhood is highly technical, my outside intersts are not.  I have wide variety of passions and interests.  I love to cook, and I have a professional scuba diver certification. More recently I have been studying blacksmithing as a hobby.</p>
            <p>I have a passion for learning and hold multiple degrees.  I have degrees and certifications in Electronics, Technical Management, Culinary Arts, Scuba Diving, Project Mangement, and an MBA.</p>
